EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud 
Popular AWS offering




Used for the following reasons 

1. Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
2. Storing Data on Virtual Machines (EBS)
3. Distributing load across machine (ELB)
4. Scaling the service using an auto scaling group (ASG)

EC2 Factors to consider (configurations options): 

What Operating System to run on? (3 Options avialable: Linux, Mac, Windows)
How Much Compute Power & Cores? (CPU)
How Much Random Access Memory? (RAM)
How Much Storage Space? - Network Attached ? - Hardware ?
Network Card ? Speed of the card ? 
Firewall Rules ?
Bootstrap Script ?

EC2 User Data gives the abilty to (bootstrap): run a pre-defined script on creation of instance:
Common Use-Cases:
Installing Updates
Installing Software 
Downloading Common files from the internet
The script runs with the root user so all comands will  have the 'sudo' keyword





EC2 Instance Types: 

* As of Right now there are 8 different types of EC2 instance types 

High level Overview: 

EC2 Naming Convention: 

ex: m5.2xlarge
m - instance class 
5 - generation
2xlarge - size within the instance class

General Purpose (Instance Type):
Great for diversity and has a balence between Compute, Memory, Networking

Compute Optimized (Instance Type):
Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high preformance 

Memory Optimized (Instance Type):
Fast peformance for workloads that process large data sets in memory

Storaged Optimized (Instance Type):
Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write acess to large data sets on local machine

if you want to compare instances this website is very helpful (instances.vantage.sh)




EC2 Security Groups:

Security groups are the fundemental of network security in AWS
controlling how traffic is allowed into or out of the EC2 instance

They contain 
Allow Rules
These Rules can reference an IP or security group


Security groups in depth: 
security groups act as a firewall on EC2 instances and they regulate Acess to ports and Authorized IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
Control Inbound Network and Outbound network

Good to know about security groups:
Security Groups can be attached to multiple instances
Instances can have multiple security groups
Locked down to a region / VPC Combination
Security Groups lives outside of the EC2 Instance
It's good to maintain one security group for SSH access
If your application is not acessible (time out) then it's a secutity group issue BUT if you recive a "connection refused " then it's an application error 
BY default all inbound traffic is BLOCKED 
BY default all outbound traffic is AUTHORIZED

Security Group Advanced Feature:
Attaching Multiple Security Groups onto a EC2 Instance can allow for direct connection without the use of IP rule checking 

PORTS:
22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a linux instance
21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files to a file share
22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
80 = HTTP - Acesss unsecured websites
442 = HTTPS - Access secured websites
3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instance




SSH (Secure Shell) Summary Table:`
* This is a utility that can be used on Mac, Linux and windows >= 10. Winodws < 10 uses putty and you can use it for Windows >= 10 another utility that can be used on all platforms is EC2 Instance Connect (*Only works on Amaxon NX2)

Mac OS (How to log in to SSH)
With the key created upon the instance (EC2Turorial.pem) - pem file is the extension with CLI use this command to log into the amazon instance ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@INSTANCEIPADDRESS




EC2 Instance Purchasing Options: 

On-Demand Instances - short workloads, predictable pricing, pay by seconds
Linux or windows - billing per second, after first minute 
all other operating systems - billing per hour
highest cost but no upfront costs
no long term commitment
*Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads


Reserved (1 & 3 years) long workloads or long workloads with flexible instances
up to 72 percent discount compared to On-Demand
You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance types, Region, Tenancy, OS)
Reservation Peroid - 1 Year (+Discount) or 3 years (+++ Discounts)
Payment Options - NO upfront, Partial Upfront, ALL Upfront
*Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)


Savings Plan (1 & 3 years ) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workloads

Get a Discount on a long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
commmit to a certian type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
Usage beyond EC2 savings plans is billed at the On-demand price
Locked to a specific instance family and region 


Spot Instances - short workloads cheap, can lose instances (less-reliable)

Up to a 90% percent discount compared to ON-Demand
Instances that you can lose at any point of time 
The most cost efficent instances in AWS
*Recommended for Useful for workloads that are resilent to failure (Data Anaysis, Batch Jobs, Image processing)
NOT SUITED FOR critical jobs or databases 

Dedicated Hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement

Physical Server that is fully dedicated to your use
Allows you address compliance requirment and use your existing server-bound license
Purchasing Options: On demand or reserved and the most expensive option
*Recommended for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL)


Dedicated Instances - no other customers will share your hardware 

Instances that run on hardware that's dedicated to you
May share hardware with other instance in same account
No control over instance placement 


Capacity Reservations - reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

Reserve On-Demand instance capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
You always have acces to EC2 capacity when you need it 
No Time Commitment
combine with regional reserved instances and saving plans to benefit from billing discounts 
You're charged at On-Demand rate wether you run instances or not
