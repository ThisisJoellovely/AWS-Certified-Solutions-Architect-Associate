Basics of IPs

Networking has two sorts of IPs.
• IPv4: 1.160.10.240
• IPv6: 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf

Differences between Public and Private IPs

Public IP: 

• Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet (WWW) 
• Must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP).
• Can be geo-located easily

Private IP: 

• Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only 
• The IP must be unique across the private network • BUT two different private networks (two companies) can have the same IPs. 
• Machines connect to WWW using a NAT + internet gateway (a proxy) 
• Only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IP

AWS also uses Elastic Ips which are defined as this 

Elastic IPs

• When you stop and then start an EC2 instance, it can change its public IP. 
• If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP 
• An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don’t delete it 
• You can attach it to one instance at a time 


 Placement Groups
How many EC2 instances are placed used for security and netowrk benifits

Cluster—clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone 
• Spread—spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ) 
• Partition—spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)

ENI (Elastic Network Interface) (Advanced Topic in AWS)

logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card
• The ENI can have the following attributes:
• Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4 
• One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4 • One Public IPv4
• One or more security groups • A MAC address 
• You can create ENI independently and attach them on the fly (move them) on EC2 instances for failover
• Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ) Availability Zone EC2 Eth0


EC2 Hibernate:
This is a method that alows for preservation of the ram and faster bootup of instances between instance shut-offs but with specific requirments in place as follows

• The in-memory (RAM) state is preserved 
• The instance boot is much faster! (the OS is not stopped / restarted) 
• Under the hood: the RAM state is written to a file in the root EBS volume 
• The root EBS volume must be encrypted
